## Installation instructions

You can find instructions on installing the miniRGBii as well as a bunch of other Wii mini mods on [Pimp-My-Mini](https://wii-mini-hacking.github.io/Pimp-My-mini/).

## Fabrication

The board gerber files, Bill of Materials, Pick-and-place and other related documents for fabrication are located in the /output directory.
Gerbers use Protel-style file extensions (compatible with JLCPCB)
Output documents specific to JLCPCB are located in the /output/jlcpcb directory.
If you would like to order the boards from a different manufacturer, you may open a pull request for any manufacturer-specific files to be added.
